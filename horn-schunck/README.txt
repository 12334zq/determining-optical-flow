- To find optical flow of images use 1 of 2 commands:
    imHS(alpha, N) - alpha is weighting factor, N is iteration number
    or:
    imHS - in this case, alpha and N get default values: alpha = 0.01, N = 512.

- To find optical flow of given video use 1 of 2 commands:
    vidHS(alpha, N) - alpha is weighting factor, N is iteration number
    or:
    vidHS - in this case, alpha and N get default values: alpha = 0.5, N = 128.
